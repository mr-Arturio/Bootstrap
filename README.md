Here I am learning and trying different Bootstrap features

You can install Bootstrap ```npm install bootstrap@5.3.1```

You can also use the old fashion method -  Place the ```link``` tag in the ```head``` for our CSS, and the ```<script>``` tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips) before the closing ```</body>```


### !!!Bootstrap JavaScript is not fully compatible with JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular!!!
A better alternative for those using this type of frameworks is to use a framework-specific package instead of the Bootstrap JavaScript.(like [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/))
